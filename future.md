# Things I Would Have Added Given More Time:
- Unit tests.
- Add logs throughout the application.
- Cusom Exceptions and error handling.
- More input validation, the app is built & configured in a way that should work fine with requests from Github but it would be best to perform some extra validations before accessing some values.
- I would also prefer to handle cases where the configurations in the .yml file aren't done properly.
-  Host a DB and save requests received in it (auditing).
- Restrict the applications to receive requests only from Github.
